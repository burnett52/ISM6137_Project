# Big_Data_Group_16
Group Project for Big Data for Business - USF - GAIBA - Group 16


Final Group Project

The final project will be a group project, with each group comprising of 4 members.

Each group is expected to take publicly available dataset, do the analysis, visualization, model creation on the dataset using Jupyter Notebook and HDFS system on Cloudera platform or DataBricks Community Edition.

## Submission:

This is a Group assignment (Member submission represents submission for all)

Please upload as below (Including, not restricted to):

Prepare a video presentation demonstrating the group project involving all members of the group. Upload this video on Youtube and submit the link in Canvas. The video length should be within 10 min.


The presentation should describe the data flow model pictorially


Video presentation should also include a description of components used, source code at a high level, demonstration of execution and results, discussion on challenges faced and solution


Upload your code on GitHub repository and submit the link on Canvas.
